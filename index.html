          The Jasmine Dragon is a traditional tea shop in the Upper Ring of Ba
          Sing Se; due to its location, its clientele mostly consists of the
          upper class citizens of the Earth Kingdom capital. It was once a
          failing business but was completely revived after Iroh took over.
